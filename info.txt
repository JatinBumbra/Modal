The modal's main idea is to set the display property whenever the user click the button.

First we write the entire html that's needed, then we style the modal. The modal's height
and width is set to 100%. Then the modal content is styled. The modal is the whole outside 
region, while the card that shows up is the modal content.

In the javascript file, the outsideClick function listens for a click on the entire window. 
On a click event, it matches if the click happened over the modal(which is the entire gray area), 
if so, the modal is closed.
